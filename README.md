# This is a candidate assessment assignment.

# Guideline

Welcome to our `Take Home Assingment`. We are going to provide you with a sequence of tasks to be executed:
* [Task 1](dockerize): Dockerize a simple Python webserver;
* [Task 2](kubernetes): Deploy that docker image to your local k8s cluster following the given spec
* [Task 3](terraform): Create a terraform script
* [Task 4](linux): Write down a shell script for further automation which involves all the previous tasks.

Please check the README.md files inside the directories to get more details about the tasks;
Please do not push this project to any public git repository. Once is done, copy the files and send back to us.

Please keep the current directories structure. Add the required files to the proper directories and 
return this assessment when you think it's totally done and functional.
